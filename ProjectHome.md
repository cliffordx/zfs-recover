This one was started as a nifty tool to drop some transactions from ZFS pool. Well... this doesn't help me so I'm gonna continue my work to the point where I can bring filesystem to importable state or read some data from it.


Update: when v28 was released with read-only pool support my problem was fixed. I don't need this project anymore.
